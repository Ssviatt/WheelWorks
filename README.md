# "WheelWorks: Ride in Style‚Äù
This is a small single-page website that sells bicycles. I made this site adaptive, so it looks good on any device.
The site includes animations on clicks and hover, a burger menu, and a form.
In my work, I applied classes based on the BEM methodology, used flex and grid, and imported fonts from Google Fonts.

The main technologies I used are HTML | SCSS | JS
